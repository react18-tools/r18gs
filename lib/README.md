## Motivation

I've developed fantastic libraries leveraging React18 features using Zustand, and they performed admirably. However, when attempting to import from specific folders for better tree-shaking, the libraries encountered issues. Each import resulted in a separate Zustand store being created, leading to increased package size.

As a solution, I set out to create a lightweight, bare minimum store that facilitates shared state even when importing components from separate files, optimizing tree-shaking.

### Important Announcement

The default export from `r18gs` is [deprecated](https://github.com/react18-tools/react18-global-store/discussions/31). Please switch to using `import { useRGS } from "r18gs"` instead. The default export will be removed in the next major release.

## Features

âœ… Full TypeScript Support

âœ… Unleash the full power of React18 Server components

âœ… Compatible with all build systems/tools/frameworks for React18

âœ… Documented with [Typedoc](https://react18-tools.github.io/react18-global-store) ([Docs](https://react18-tools.github.io/react18-global-store))

âœ… Examples for Next.js, Vite, and Remix

## Simple Global State Shared Across Multiple Components

Utilize this hook similarly to the `useState` hook. However, ensure to pass a unique key, unique across the app, to identify and make this state accessible to all client components.

```tsx
const [state, setState] = useRGS<number>("counter", 1);
```

**_or_**

```tsx
const [state, setState] = useRGS<number>("counter", () => 1);
```

## Using Plugins

Enhance the functionality of the store by leveraging either the `create` function, `withPlugins` function, or the `useRGSWithPlugins` hook from `r18gs/dist/with-plugins`, enabling features such as storing to local storage, among others.

```tsx
// store.ts
import { create } from "r18gs/dist/with-plugins";
import { persist } from "r18gs/dist/plugins"; /** You can create your own plugin or import third-party plugins */

export const useMyPersistentCounterStore = create<number>("persistent-counter", 0, [persist()]);
```

Now, you can utilize `useMyPersistentCounterStore` similarly to `useState` without specifying an initial value.

```tsx
const [persistedCount, setPersistedCount] = useMyPersistentCounterStore();
```
