## Motivation

I have built wonderful libraries utilizing React18 features using Zustand. They worked awesome. However, when I try importing from specific folder for better tree-shaking, the libraries fail. This is because, for each import a separate zustand store is created. This actually increases the package size also.

Thus, I decided to create a bare minimum, ultra-light store that creates shared state even while importing components from separate files for better treeshaking.

## Features

âœ… Full TypeScript Support

âœ… Unleash the full power of React18 Server components

âœ… Works with all build systems/tools/frameworks for React18

âœ… Works for both client side and server side components (be careful, separate states are created for server side and client side. Any changes done on client side will not affect the server components.)

âœ… Doccumented with [Typedoc](https://react18-tools.github.io/react18-global-store) ([Docs](https://react18-tools.github.io/react18-global-store))

âœ… Next.js, Vite and Remix examples

## Install

> A canonical package with longer name is also published `react18-global-store`

```bash
$ pnpm add r18gs
```

or

```bash
$ npm install r18gs
```

or

```bash
$ yarn add r18gs
```

## Usage

Use this hook similar to `useState` hook.

The difference is that you need to pass an unique key - unique across the app to identify
and make this state accessible to all client components.

```tsx
const [state, setState] = useRGS<number>("counter", 1);
```

You can access the same state across all client side components using unique.

> It is recommended to store your keys in separate file to avoid typos and unnecessary conflicts.

### Example

```tsx
// constants/global-states.ts
export const COUNTER = "counter";
```

```tsx
// components/display.tsx
"use client";

import useRGS from "r18gs";
import { COUNTER } from "../constants/global-states";

export default function Display() {
	const [count] = useRGS<number>(COUNTER);
	return (
		<div>
			<h2>Client component 2</h2>
			<b>{count}</b>
		</div>
	);
}
```

```tsx
// components/counter.tsx
"use client";

import useRGS from "r18gs";
import { COUNTER } from "../constants/global-states";

export default function Counter() {
	const [count, setCount] = useRGS(COUNTER, 0);
	return (
		<div>
			<h2>Clinet component 1</h2>
			<input
				onChange={e => {
					setCount(parseInt(e.target.value.trim()));
				}}
				type="number"
				value={count}
			/>
		</div>
	);
}
```
